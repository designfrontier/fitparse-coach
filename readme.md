# FitParse Coach

Some scripts for pulling stats out of .fit files to feed to ChatGPT for cycling
coaching.

You want to run both of them for each file you are analyzing. So you would do:
`python parse {filepath/name}` and then `python intervals {filepath/name}`

And paste the combined result to chatgpt.

## Setup

`pip install fitparse pandas numpy`
